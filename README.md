# monomer-samples-lz
Annotated monomer samples to help with deciphering the library.

Current samples:
\
\

MinimumApps: Start here to see how to get monomer to open up a window.
\

MinMonomerApp: Annotated minimal monomer application without type signatures. If it compiles, it \ works, no?

MinIdiomaticApp:
    The above application with type signatures and some explanations of the \
  underlying functions.

\
\

HelloWorlds: Fuller introductory samples. More problematic is the need to include assets with your \
monomer program, and you'll see some approaches to such here.
